GOALS
    Explore implementing a *simple topic map* in clojure; nothing particularly fancy.
    Will work on tables in postgres
    Runs from Datahike and persists in Datalog using various schemas.
    Schemas mostly deal with node (SubjectProxy) specifications

PLANS
    Using clojure Protocols to define backside (and maybe other) APIs
        For a pluggable backside
            In the nearterm, we talk directly to postgress
            In the long run, we talk, instead, to HyperKnowledge over http
MASTER TODO
    ON HOLD: Boot the postgres provider:ii postges.clj
        entails runnning a quick query test to see that something is already there.
        On hold because I can already talk to postgres in Datahike tests
    Evolve and test protocols and implementations
        There is protocols.clj which defines "core-proxy" which is a minimal API for proxies
            Not sure we need that
        Need: a backside prototocol - equivalent to an extend map interface
    Implement the postgres backside
    Implement some integration tests

        Started keeping notes
        renamed prototols to proxy_api
        added backside_api as a protocol
